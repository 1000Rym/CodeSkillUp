# This is the Coding Test (python)
This book is made for practice coding skills, By challenging the problems listed in the book "이것이 취업을 위한 코딩 테스트이다. with Python"

## Good Sites for learning algorithms.
### For the Beginner

    - Testing Hours: 2 ~ 2.5 hours.

### Challanger 
[Jungol(정올)](http://jungol.co.kr): 국내 유명 알고리즘 싸이트.


## Greedy Algorithm
Definition: Always choosing the most obvious and immediate benifit.

### Problem1: change(거스름돈)
Assume that there coins in 500$, 100$ 50$, 10$. How to return minimum Coins. 
- My solution: [change.py](greedy/chagne.py)

### Problem2: bigger numbers(큰 수의 법칙)
Find Bigger numbers(The problem definition is not explained properly though). 
- My solution: [bigger_numbers.py](greedy/bigger_numbers.py)

- Note: Although in hardware design `%, *, div` are costing alot, but in software, it is recommended to use this operators than using `-` or `+` with loop.
