This repositoy is made for learning C++. The page is mainly separated to the following parts.

- [Advanced](advanced/README.md): In advanced section 1) we are going to treat the associate OOP(Object Oriented Programming) such as encapsulationn, inheritance, polymorphism, etc. 2) Generic algorithm and programming skills are also added to in this section. We also discuss some non-stl and stl(Standard Library) data structures, and associate containers. 3) At last we are going to learn about how to handling the errors in C++. 
- Mordern: In mordern page, we are going to add some mordern skills in C++. 
- Test Framwork: The things related to the test framwork will be added to the test framework part.
- [Coding Exercise](exercise/README.md) : Exercise simple cpp problems and review cpp knowledge.
